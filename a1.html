<h1>Lassi</h1>

most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink" in India.[3] It has also been described as the form in which yogurt "is
most cherished and unbeatably popular in [...] Punjab", its "best-loved summer drink", and "the air conditioner of the
Punjab".[4]

Lassi originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.[3] The word 'lassi' means yogurt mixed with water in
Punjabi and Hindi-Urdu.[1][5]

<section id="lahori chicken karahi">
<p>Chicken karahi, or kadai chicken, is a chicken dish from South Asia. It is known as gosht karahi when prepared with goat
or lamb meat instead of chicken.

The dish is prepared in a karahi (a type of wok) and can take between 30 and 50 minutes to prepare and cook the
dish.[1][2] Ginger, garlic, tomatoes, green chilli and coriander are key to the flavor of the dish.[3] What
distinguishes chicken karahi from other curries from the region is that traditionally, it is cooked without onions in
the base, and instead uses just tomatoes, ginger and garlic.</p>
